I walk into the local cafè, perusing the extensive tea selection pretending that today might be the day I stray from my usual espresso-filled beverage. "You must try this", the barista softly exclaims. I turn, noticing a familiar, friendly face that often greets me at this establishment. Without hesitation, I agree. I trust this other person to know if I would genuinely enjoy this thing—quickly learning I'm about to consume a freshly squeezed watermelon lime cold brew. I'm intrigued and pleased by the strange recommendation. This was someone sharing their passion with _me_.

> Consumption versus creation

I maintain notes of these moments, although not as often as I would prefer. It's important to me to form my own positive opinions of people around me, contrast to the hyper-curated online profiles. When people approach me with a simple question or comment, it immediately switches my brain from being potentially judgemental to excited and comforted. My walls are dropped as if that micro interaction was the confirmation needed to realise the world is full of other sentient beings. _Sonder_.

```
- The one who makes the best vegan BLTs, sharing a contagious smile and glowful energy
- The one who encourages me to write, a blessing to both the real and the digital world
- The one who sits with me like a Parisian, appreciating each breath in this beautfiul world
- The one who asked what my lil espresso was, sparking conversation of recent travels
- The one who has not yet been met, enspelling curiousity on what will be

Create connections. Grow relationships. You're not alone in this world.
