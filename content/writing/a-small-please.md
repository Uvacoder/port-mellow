My favourite drink is a dry cappuccino. I'm not quite sure what the "dry" part means yet but the specificity invokes a sense of illustriousness. Why is it, then, that my most _ordered_ drink is a latte? Let's dive into this riveting phenomenon, also expressed as "quality over quantity".

| Drink           | Size           | Price \* |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Cappuccino      | 177 ml / 6 oz  | $3.50    |
| Flavoured latte | 591 ml / 16 oz | $7.00    |

_\* Prices estimated based on past experience. All prices include oat milk substitute._

Draft notes:

- Calculate yearly difference between getting a capp vs large latte every day
