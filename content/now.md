## 2022-07-20 Altruism

I'm slowly transition into working on other's open source projects rather than my own. There's a great joy in helping. Let's create together.

## 2022-07-04 Digital garden

Started a personal website redesign with no javascript, small images, and a focus on sustainability and sharing my journey. Embracing functional minimalism.
