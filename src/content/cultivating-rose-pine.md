## Grounded aesthetics

After reading [a case against syntax highlighting](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/), I was inspired to create a somehow-unique _monochromatic_ colourscheme. After trying several shades of grey, I started to feel tied down. A hopeful search for [earthy colours](https://dribbble.com/search/earthy-colours) brought _something beautiful_ to fruition.

## Naturally growing community

A small group of humans discovered Rosé Pine shortly after its initial release. I baked a loaf of bread, they started a bakery. Our little theme was spreading like melted plant-based butter. Happiness. Thank you.
