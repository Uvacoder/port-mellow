Our garden lives on a two square meter balcony and consists of tomatoes,
baby pumpkins, and lettuce all housed in fabric grow bags. This is the first
time we've tried to grow anything edible. There's something calming yet exhilarating about the process of waking up, walking outside, and seeing real growth. We did this.

_Seeds in small places_

We nibbled on a small piece of lettuce and that got us excited for absolutely anything that comes out of this. My goal is a single tomato. Patience.
