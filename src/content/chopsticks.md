I'm obsessed with restriction. Choosing to have only one all-black outfit stopped the constant inner-voice nagging me to buy that new shirt with a pattern or color that _felt like me_. Removing animal products from my life has naturally narrowed down my selection of food, cleaning supplies, and other possessions. These restrictions, whether artificially or ethically imposed, encourage me to live a simpler life while reducing decision fatigue.

> Restrictions should be healthy and enjoyable. Deprivation will quickly cause you to fall back to old habits.

According to a [study about mindless eating](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219989/), the amount we eat increases when distracted. Personally, enjoying a meal while watching Friends (\~22 minutes runtime) or Grey's Anatomy (\~48 minutes runtime) is one of my favorite past times. Because my cravings match the length of my current show, I end up filling any extra time with larger portions, salty chips and mayo, or a dark chocolate sweet.

Some people may be strong enough to simply eat slower with a fork. My weak self-control treats a fork like a power-tool for consuming. Replacing a fork with a pair of artisanal, handmade chopsticks not only made me enjoy the process of eating more, but physically slowed me down. Now lunchtime feels like driving a manual car, necessitating a blissful and intentional focus.
